# <codeQuiz>


Mock-Up

## Description
The goal of this project, 'Code Quiz', is to create a user interface that presents multiple choice questions to the user. In addition to correct/ incorrect functionality, there is the added complexity of a timer that deducts time for incorrect responses.  The actual use of the right/wrong response alongside increment/decrement time could be changed depending on the use case.  In this project I encountered issues with storing data to local storage for a 'Hall-of-Fame' feature that is yet to be resolved.  Working on the practical application of retrieving questions and printing them to the screen was particularly satisfying to me given the potential applications for such functionality.  In future projects, I would like to continue to develop the relationship between user input and data that is displayed for all visitors to a site.

User Story

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
